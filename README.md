# mychattybot
A simple bot that talks to you.
This is my first ever kotlin project. 
The bot starts by introducing it's name and creation year to the user. It then goes on to ask for the user's name,
and tries to guess the user's age by asking for some numbers.
The bot can also count up to whatever number the user inputs.
Lastly, it tests the user's programming knowledge and only stops after the correct answer.
